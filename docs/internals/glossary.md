## Concepts

### Project and workspace

#### Project

The top-level workspace record in the app. In [the orchestration contracts][1], a project has a `workspaceRoot` and a title. It does not contain threads: `OrchestrationProject` and `OrchestrationThread` are separate arrays on the read model, and a project can have zero threads. See [workspace-layout.md][2].

#### Workspace root

The root filesystem path for a project. In [the orchestration model][1], it is the base directory for branches and optional worktrees. See [workspace-layout.md][2].

#### Worktree

A Git worktree used as an isolated workspace for a thread. If a thread has a `worktreePath` in [the contracts][1], it runs there instead of in the main working tree. Git operations live behind the VCS driver contract in `apps/server/src/vcs/VcsDriver.ts`, implemented by [GitVcsDriverCore.ts][3].

#### Storage inventory

A server-side scan of **managed worktrees** under the environment's worktrees folder (`storage.getInventory` / `storage.streamInventory` / `storage.removeOrphan` in [the contracts][1]). Clients gate on the `storageInventory` capability and never probe older servers. Servers that advertise `storageInventoryStream` push incremental inventories while the walk is still running; older servers only answer the unary query. Project checkouts outside that folder are never listed or deleted. Unique paths are counted once when several threads share a checkout. `isDirty === null` is unsafe, never clean.

### Thread timeline

#### Thread

The main durable unit of conversation and workspace history. In [the orchestration contracts][1], a thread holds messages, activities, checkpoints, and session-related state. See [projector.ts][4].

#### Turn

A single user-to-assistant work cycle inside a thread. It starts with user input and ends when the session leaves `running` status, which [projector.ts][4] treats as the authoritative completion signal (`settledTurnStateForSessionStatus`). Checkpoint and diff work may settle afterward without changing when the turn ended. See [the contracts][1] and [ProviderRuntimeIngestion.ts][5].

#### Activity

A user-visible log item attached to a thread. In [the contracts][1], activities cover important non-message events like approvals, tool actions, and failures. They are projected into thread state in [projector.ts][4].

#### Search index

The plain-table inverted index behind `orchestration.searchThreads`: `search_index_docs` / `search_index_terms` / `search_index_postings` (migration 049), maintained by the `projection.search-index` projector in [ProjectionPipeline.ts][11] and read with BM25 ranking in `apps/server/src/search/ThreadSearch.ts`. It indexes user messages (visible text only, auto-PR instruction block stripped) and canonical assistant messages (turn-final `assistant_message_id` rows). Plain tables because the production SQLite driver (`node:sqlite`) ships without FTS5; query semantics are exact-term AND with prefix matching on the final query token.

### Orchestration

Orchestration is the server-side domain layer that turns runtime activity into stable app state. The main entry point is [OrchestrationEngine.ts][7], with core logic in [decider.ts][8] and [projector.ts][4].

#### Aggregate

The domain object a command or event belongs to. In [the contracts][1], that is usually `project` or `thread`. See [decider.ts][8].

#### Command

A typed request to change domain state. In [the contracts][1], commands are validated in [commandInvariants.ts][9] and turned into events by [decider.ts][8].
Examples include `thread.create`, `thread.turn.start`, and `thread.checkpoint.revert`.

#### Domain Event

A persisted fact that something already happened. In [the contracts][1], events are the source of truth, and [projector.ts][4] shows how they are applied.
Examples include `thread.created`, `thread.message-sent`, and `thread.turn-diff-completed`.

#### Decider

The pure orchestration logic that turns commands plus current state into events. The core implementation is in [decider.ts][8], with preconditions in [commandInvariants.ts][9].

#### Projection

A read-optimized view derived from events. See [projector.ts][4], [ProjectionPipeline.ts][11], and [ProjectionSnapshotQuery.ts][10].

#### Projector

The logic that applies domain events to the read model or projection tables. See [projector.ts][4] and [ProjectionPipeline.ts][11].

#### Read model

The current materialized view of orchestration state. In [the contracts][1], it holds projects, threads, messages, activities, checkpoints, and session state. See [ProjectionSnapshotQuery.ts][10] and [OrchestrationEngine.ts][7].

#### Thread-touched

The cheap shell stream delta (`{threadId, updatedAt, sequence}`) sent instead of a full `thread-upserted` when a thread event only appended a message or activity, so a streaming turn does not re-send the whole `OrchestrationThreadShell` per delta. Built once per server in [ShellStream.ts][25] and fanned out to every `subscribeShell` subscriber. See [the contracts][1].

#### Ephemeral event

A `thread.activity-appended` that is streamed to `subscribeThread` subscribers but never appended to the event store: it carries `sequence: 0` and the stream item is flagged `ephemeral: true`, so clients apply it in place without moving their resume cursor (older clients drop it at their cursor gate). Used for in-flight tool progress: [ToolProgress.ts][26] keeps the latest `tool.updated` per `(thread, item)` under the stable id `${itemId}:progress`, splices it into thread detail snapshots, and only a coalesced tick (at most every 3 s) plus a turn-end flush is persisted. See [the contracts][1] and [ProviderRuntimeIngestion.ts][5].

#### Reactor

A side-effecting service that handles follow-up work after events or runtime signals. Examples include [CheckpointReactor.ts][6], [ProviderCommandReactor.ts][12], and [ProviderRuntimeIngestion.ts][5].

#### Receipt

A typed signal emitted when an async milestone completes, such as `checkpoint.baseline.captured`, `checkpoint.diff.finalized`, or `turn.processing.quiesced`. Receipts are a test-only mechanism: the production `RuntimeReceiptBusLive` publish is a no-op and only the test layer is PubSub-backed. Do not build production behavior on them. See [RuntimeReceiptBus.ts][13] and [CheckpointReactor.ts][6].

#### Quiesced

"Quiesced" means a turn has gone quiet and stable: follow-up work such as [CheckpointReactor.ts][6] has settled. It appears in [the receipt schema][13], so in practice it is something tests wait on rather than a production signal.

### Provider runtime

The live backend agent implementation and its event stream. The main service is [ProviderService.ts][14], the adapter contract is [ProviderAdapter.ts][15], and the overview is in [providers.md][16].

#### Provider

The backend agent runtime that actually performs work. Five drivers ship built in: Codex, Claude, Cursor, Grok, and Kimi. See [ProviderService.ts][14], [ProviderAdapter.ts][15], and [CodexAdapter.ts][17] as a representative adapter.

#### Session

The live provider-backed runtime attached to a thread. Session shape is in [the orchestration contracts][1], and lifecycle is managed in [ProviderService.ts][14].

#### Runtime mode

The safety/access mode for a thread or session. [The contracts][1] define four values: `approval-required`, `auto-accept-edits`, `auto`, and `full-access`. See [permission modes][18].

#### Interaction mode

The agent interaction style for a thread. In [the contracts][1], the values are `default` and `plan`.

#### Subagent policy

Whether a thread may spawn provider-native children, and which model those children should use. Global defaults live in server settings; a thread can inherit, turn spawning off, or pin its own child. T3 observes native Task/collab children — it does not spawn them. See [subagents](../user/subagents.md) and `packages/contracts/src/subagentPolicy.ts`.

#### App

An external service (Gmail, GitHub, Linear, …) connected to an environment as a remote MCP server, reached by every provider through the server's `/mcp/apps/<id>` proxy and addressed in chat as `@slug`. Records live in `ServerSettings.apps` (server-written), credentials in the secret store. See `packages/contracts/src/apps.ts`, `packages/contracts/src/appsCatalog.ts`, and [apps.md](./apps.md).

#### Assistant delivery mode

Controls how assistant text reaches the thread timeline. In [the contracts][1], `streaming` updates incrementally and `buffered` accumulates text. Buffered delivery is not held until the turn completes: it spills once accumulated text would exceed 24,000 characters, and flushes at approval and user-input boundaries. See [ProviderRuntimeIngestion.ts][5].

#### Snapshot

A point-in-time view of state. The word is used in multiple layers, including orchestration, provider, and checkpointing. See [ProjectionSnapshotQuery.ts][10], [ProviderAdapter.ts][15], and [CheckpointStore.ts][19].

### Checkpointing

Checkpointing captures workspace state over time so the app can diff turns and restore earlier points. The main pieces are [CheckpointStore.ts][19], [CheckpointDiffQuery.ts][20], and [CheckpointReactor.ts][6].

#### Checkpoint

A saved snapshot of a thread workspace at a particular turn. In practice it is a hidden Git ref in [CheckpointStore.ts][19] plus a projected summary from [ProjectionCheckpoints.ts][21]. Capture and lifecycle work happen in [CheckpointReactor.ts][6].

#### Checkpoint ref

The durable identifier for a filesystem checkpoint, stored as a Git ref. It is typed in [the contracts][1], constructed in [Utils.ts][22], and used by [CheckpointStore.ts][19].

#### Checkpoint baseline

The starting checkpoint for diffing a thread timeline. This flow is surfaced through [RuntimeReceiptBus.ts][13], coordinated in [CheckpointReactor.ts][6], and supported by [Utils.ts][22].

#### Checkpoint diff

The patch difference between two checkpoints. Query logic lives in [CheckpointDiffQuery.ts][20], diff parsing lives in [Diffs.ts][23], and finalization is coordinated by [CheckpointReactor.ts][6].

#### Turn diff

The file patch and changed-file summary for one turn. It is usually computed in [CheckpointDiffQuery.ts][20], represented in [the contracts][1], and recorded into thread state by [projector.ts][4].

## Practical Shortcuts

- If you see `requested`, think "intent recorded".
- If you see `completed`, think "result applied".
- If you see `receipt`, think "async milestone signal, for tests".
- If you see `checkpoint`, think "workspace snapshot for diff/restore".
- If you see `quiesced`, think "all relevant follow-up work has gone idle".
