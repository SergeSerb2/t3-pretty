# Voice input

Transcription edits a composer draft. It does not submit an agent turn. Audio is
temporary client input, and only normal message submission sends the resulting
text. Internal clients can use a connected Groq host independently of the draft's
environment. The host is chosen from live advertised capabilities and bound for
the recording, so another machine coming online cannot redirect captured audio.
Only the host holds the Groq key. Supported iOS devices retain local transcription
when no Groq host is available.

The mobile [shared controller](../../packages/client-runtime/src/voice-input/controller.ts)
owns the operation while the client supplies capture and transcription. Preparation
binds the transcriber and resolved locale for the whole recording. Draft ownership,
text, and revision are captured before recording and checked before insertion, so
a late transcript cannot overwrite a draft that was edited or replaced.

Cancellation invalidates a result immediately, but resources stay owned until the
underlying work settles. Apple's native transcription call cannot be interrupted
once started. Releasing the session or deleting its recording when the abort signal
fires would race that work. The [transcription contract](../../packages/client-runtime/src/voice-input/transcription.ts)
therefore requires implementations to settle only after their work has stopped;
the [Apple binding](../../apps/mobile/src/native/voiceTranscription.ios.ts) checks
cancellation between native calls and discards late results.
